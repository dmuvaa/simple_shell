This GitHub repository contains the source code for a simple Unix shell implementation written in C. The shell is designed to be portable and to work on various Unix-like operating systems.

The implementation provides a command prompt where users can enter commands and have them executed by the shell. It supports standard Unix shell features like executing external commands, piping commands together, and running commands in the background. In addition, it has a few built-in commands like "cd" for changing directories and "exit" for exiting the shell.

The source code is well-documented and organized into several files that handle different aspects of the shell's functionality, such as parsing user input and executing commands.
